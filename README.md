# Clinic Management System

## Description

The project clinic management is a software developed to simplify the communication process between the doctor and the receptionist.  Receptionist would be responsible for assigning token numbers to the patient visiting the clinic and save it in the database along with their details. These token numbers along with respective patient details are sent to doctor. The doctor can thus view patient details and after checking up the patient, the recommended medicines for the particular patient are fed into the database by the doctor and are sent to receptionist.
